# WooCommerce Variation Table

Adds a customizable table view of product variations for WooCommerce variable products, with sorting and filtering capabilities.

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.8 or higher
- WooCommerce 5.0 or higher
- PHP 7.4 or higher

## Updates

This plugin uses a custom update system that checks for new versions directly from GitHub. Updates are distributed through GitHub releases and not through the WordPress.org plugin repository.

### How updates work

1. The plugin periodically checks for updates by fetching the `plugin-info.json` file from the GitHub repository
2. If a new version is available and meets the minimum requirements, an update notification will appear in the WordPress admin
3. Updates can be installed directly through the WordPress plugin updater interface
4. Update information is cached for 24 hours to minimize API requests

### Manual updates

If you prefer to update manually, you can:
1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/thoaud/wc-variation-table/releases)
2. Deactivate and delete the existing plugin through WordPress admin
3. Upload and activate the new version
